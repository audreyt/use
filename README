NAME
    use - Import several modules with a single use statement

SYNOPSIS
        # Import several modules at once
        use use qw[ strict warnings methods invoker ];

        # Pass options as array refs
        use use 'strict', 'warnings', 'HTTP::Status' => [':constants'];

        # Pass required versions after module names
        use use '5.12.0', 'HTTP::Status' => '6.00' => [':constants'];

        # ...or in your own module, importing on behalf of its caller:
        package perl5::foo;
        sub import {
            use use;
            local @_ = qw[ methods invoker ];
            goto &use::use;
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This module imports several modules at once into its caller's package.

    This is almost the same as the modules module, except that "caller" is
    properly set up so syntax-altering modules based on Devel::Declare,
    Filter::Simple or Module::Compile can work corrcetly.
